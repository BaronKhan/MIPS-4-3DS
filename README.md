# MIPS43DS
Simple port of a MIPS32 simulator for Nintendo 3DS.
v0.1. This is just a first attempt at 3DS homebrew, and will remain a proof-of-concept. Note that not all instructions will work, and some are still broken. Uses the libctru library by smealum.

# Usage
Place MIPS binary files in the same directory as mips43ds.3dsx.
